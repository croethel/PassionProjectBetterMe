## Passion Project: BetterMe

BetterMe is a web-based platform designed to allow users to track behaviors surrounding their mental health and well-being. The user will be able to login and complete a daily log of their behaviors and mood. The goal of this is to be able to overtime identify patterns in behaviors that may help improve overall mental health.

Additionally, BetterMe provides a library of resources for common areas that many people struggled with.

We live in a world where there are an unlimited amount of resources and information available to help with mental health. The goal of BetterMe is to be able to reduce how overwhelming finding the right place to start can be.

My MVP will allow a user to create a profile and begin tracking their behaviors, which being able to see trends of how each area impacts their mental health and mood. 

Iâ€™ll do this using Python, Django, Heroku and a SQL database to maintain records.
